Here's a short two-minute video outlining what we are going to do here.

You can enlarge the video to full-screen by clicking in the bottom-right corner of the video.

The first step is to navigate to [astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=devplay&utm_medium=katacoda&utm_campaign=astra-core-course) and login or sign up for an account!

Next, create a database as described in the video (you can also follow along in the [Astra DB Docs](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html)).

<ol>
  <li>Click on the _Create Database_ button in the top-left corner of the screen</li>
  <li>Within the _Pay as you go_ box, click the _Get Started_ button (don't worry - it won't cost anything)</li>
  <li>On the _Create a Database_ screen, enter the Database name: _betterbotz_</li>
  <li>Also enter the Keyspace name: _betterbotz_</li>
  <li>Select your favorite cloud provider</li>
  <li>Select a region nearest your location</li>
  <li>Click the _Create Database_ button on the right.</li>
  <li>When you see the _Get Ready for Lift Off_ dialog, click the _Continue_ button</li>
</ol>

It will take a few minutes for the database to initialize, but once the database is ready, you will receive an email and you will see the database status change to _active_.

## Woot! Your Cassandra database is ready to go!
