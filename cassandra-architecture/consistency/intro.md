In this scenario, you will:

* Understand the differences between consistency vs. replication factor.
* Understand the differences of consistency on a write vs. a read.

One of the challenges of distributed systems like Apache Cassandraâ„¢, is how to keep the data replicas consistent. Maintaining consistency requires balancing availability and partitioning. Fortunately, Cassandra lets you tune this balancing to your needs.

In this scenario we will tinker with consistency levels using operations that read and write.
