*One of the easiest ways to get started with Apache Cassandra™ is using Astra DB*

In this scenario, we'll learn how to:
- Create an Astra DB database
- Create a container for cqlsh that connects to Astra DB
- Create a table in Astra DB
- Insert and query data

Astra DB is a great Cassandra as a Service offering and Docker containers are really slick, so this is going to be fun! Let's get started!

_This scenario is also available on our [datastax.com/dev](https://www.datastax.com/dev/scenario/astra-access-container) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandra™._
